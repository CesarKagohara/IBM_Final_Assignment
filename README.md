# Covid-19 - New food deliveries
<h3> Introduction </h3>
Introduction/Business Problem
Nowadays, due to Covid-19, restaurants around the world are closed. Many jobs have been lost, with chances of never opening again. The businesses need to reinvent themselves, being creative to develop new ways of working, and creating new sales channels, but the small and new restaurants maybe don't have the budget to improve the service or they are indebted to the Bank.
As a support to the new and small restaurant, a map will be created displaying the venues with a low number of likes, photos, and created this year(2020). The people that can't go out due to lockdown, can exchange experience and supporting the local restaurants, sharing dices photos and liking the pages.
